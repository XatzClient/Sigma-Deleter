We've seen that a lot of people have been calling this a virus, so we've decided to make a video thoroughly debunking it with some solid proof

# How to use?

I can't believe I have to explain this, 
- you go to releases and download the latest release, as of now, this is the latest [release](https://github.com/XatzClient/Sigma-Deleter/releases/download/v1.10/Sigma-Deleter_v1.3.jar)
- you then double click the jar and then press delete sigma, (Make sure you have java installed though, https://mega.nz/folder/EolCyShY#D0QUZdcafG1mUXbqWywFsg/file/Z4sgCCwA use this link for a swift install of java.) 

----- Additional Help -----

- If you got java, but jar wont open the GUI for sigma deleter, use this https://www.heise.de/software/download/jarfix/41657 If you are on linux and you have issues, then congrats! You finally have the best type of OS (only use Arch and Arch based distro's tho, they are just the best). - NaakteMolrattenZijnCool 
- If you have linux and have issues with opening the jar, cd into the folder that contains the jar and type `java -jar Sigma-Deleter_v1.3.jar` or whatever the jar you downloaded was called, if you have more issues, ~~go fuck yourself Nerd~~ figure it out yourself.. ------ Napoleon
